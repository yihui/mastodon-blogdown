# tinytex

> **Brenton Wiernik 🏳️‍🌈** (@bmwiernik; 2/0): @samuelmehr @GKountourides I’d recommend just removing TeXLive/MacTeX and letting tinytex handle it for you everywhere  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1278840670506102784)

> **でみあん** (@hatenademian; 1/0): 話がガラッと変わって、勉強用のノートをRで作るためにR Markdownを使っていたのですが、その時に起こる色々なトラブルがTex Live 2020を入れたら大体解決してしまいました。

> **SAM** (@samuelmehr; 1/0): @bmwiernik @GKountourides fully removing tinytex (`tlmgr remove --all`) and reinstalling it via R seems to have done the trick, though now all my packages are gone 😢  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1278846962108755968)

> **SAM** (@samuelmehr; 1/0): @bmwiernik @GKountourides what's funny is that tinytex is the distribution I thought I was using in the first place. super weird bug  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1278845446866124801)

<!-- -->


> **SAM** (@samuelmehr; 1/0): @bmwiernik @GKountourides totally bizarre that TeX would fritz out on its own, though. literally knitted something yesterday on the same machine with no issues... will try to play around with tinytex later  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1278843347319156736)

<!-- -->


> **SAM** (@samuelmehr; 1/0): @bmwiernik @GKountourides I've got tinytex installed, is there a way to force R to use that instead of other tex distributions on the same computer?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1278839306618990592)

<!-- -->


> **Brenton Wiernik 🏳️‍🌈** (@bmwiernik; 1/0): @samuelmehr @GKountourides tinytex is an R package with accompanying lightweight tex distribution  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1278837573109059584)

> **Brenton Wiernik 🏳️‍🌈** (@bmwiernik; 1/0): @samuelmehr @GKountourides Try installing tinytex and using that instead? It manages packages dynamically  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1278836964297510912)

# xaringan

> **Denis Cohen** (@denis_cohen; 1/0): @rruizrufino @MZESUniMannheim @KingsQPE Sure! That just requires changing the corporate color definitions and logo in the preamble (Beamer) or in mtheme.css and insert-logo.html (xaringan), respectively.

> **Mine CetinkayaRundel** (@minebocek; 1/0): @KellyBodwin You're welcome! My one issue with this approach is that you end up needing to use the infinite moon reader for the css file to be picked up from another directory (assuming you have xaringan slides), and I have a ❤️/🤬 relationship with the infinite moon reader.

> **Joseph Casillas** (@jvcasill; 1/0): @ChelseaParlett It would be cool if you put them in a public repo. Then I could include them in my #xaringan slides using the url and never download them 😍  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1279133965354520578)
