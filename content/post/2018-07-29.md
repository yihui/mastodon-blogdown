> **Jolene Smith** (@aejolene; 3/0): @CDWren I recommend setting it up when you have something much more pressing to do. Seriously, though, blogdown with Hugo is definitely the lowest friction workflow I've found yet! I'm definitely converted.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1023246158238498816)

The main point of this contest is to recognize bookdown examples that are reusable, e.g. a syllabus template that other teachers can use.
