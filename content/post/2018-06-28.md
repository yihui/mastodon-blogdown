> **Claus Wilke** (@ClausWilke; 7/0): @tjmahr @ellis2013nz @MilesMcBain @kara_woo Exactly. Also, I've got 20+ years of LaTeX experience, have published well over 100 papers written in it, and use it daily. Yet, I'd never have started a book project on #dataviz without bookdown. Managing all the visual assets manually would be way too painful.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011815785118011393)

> **Peter Ellis** (@ellis2013nz; 4/0): @MilesMcBain @kara_woo @ClausWilke The irritating thing is, there is definitely plenty of room for discussion about whether bookdown is a helpful addition to "whatever it takes" given the existence of LaTeX, Illustrator/InDesign etc.; but why is it necessary to add in the "real scientists" slur?

> **David Hood** (@Thoughtfulnz; 0/0): @ellis2013nz @MilesMcBain @kara_woo @ClausWilke Coming from teaching Illustrator, Indesign and Rmarkdown, bookdown is extremely good at multiple outputs. Yes, you can make a more aesthetically nice book in InDesign supported by Illustrator, but for multiple output mediums &amp; if you work in R anyway, it is not just about print  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011827769615872000)

# knitr

> **Omar Wasow** (@owasow; 2/0): @kjhealy @hadleywickham @PrincetonUPress In the weeds question about Rmd vs Rnw: Years ago Yihui suggested markdown was better for html output &amp; latex for pages. As Rmd can incorporate latex, I wonder if you think that distinction is now moot. I ask mainly because I puzzle whether to keep teaching Sweave+Latex+knitr+R.

> **Kieran Healy** (@kjhealy; 1/0): @owasow @hadleywickham @PrincetonUPress I think it's moot. In the pipeline I use, the same Rmd goes to both HTML and LaTeX/PDF via knitr &amp; pandoc.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012127822133985285)
