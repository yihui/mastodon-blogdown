> **Sharla Gelfand** (@sharlagelfand; 2/0): @phoebewong2012 @DrJMLuther @rstatsbot1234 thank you! you can definitely do plotly but i'm not sure about shiny! some googling indicates maybe? (https://t.co/njdwoxBmBx https://t.co/U7vbzirN6i?) but definitely not something i've done before  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/966138473878097920)

> **Dorian Gray** (@GrayAnalyst; 1/0): @thomas_mock blogdown has serve_site () which will then previews the file in the viewer (same pane as plots and help). Bit of ovrhead though  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/966156876193959936)

> **Phoebe Wong** (@phoebewong2012; 1/0): @sharlagelfand @DrJMLuther @rstatsbot1234 I believe I was visualizing something like this when I asked the question:
https://t.co/icXIbJAtVt and wondering if it's possible to host like a combination of shiny and plotly in #blogdown  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/966137062608031744)

> **Phoebe Wong** (@phoebewong2012; 1/0): @sharlagelfand @DrJMLuther @rstatsbot1234 Yes! Ha! I was told that blogdown is only for static content, therefore, plotly isn't supported. Looks like that's not the case! Thanks for sharing, that is very cool visualization (and detailed explanation of the code as well!)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/966136067832340480)
