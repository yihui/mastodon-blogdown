> **Dan Ovando** (@DanOvand0; 4/0): @ecodatasci Thanks! Now that I've emerged from the dissertation cave, blog-post on the process of writing a dissertation in #rstats/#bookdown coming shortly, takes some up-front work but definitely worth it  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1033123284244606976)

I don't like to open an issue cold because the language around 'issue' makes it sound like a problem. At least this way you know it's coming!

> **Andrew Kniss** (@WyoWeeds; 1/0): So now you can click a link and BAM! you got a 148 page pdf with all the same information we've put on the web. Again, all because of the work of @xieyihui making it super easy to do with the bookdown package.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1033103214604763141)

<!-- -->


> **Andrew Kniss** (@WyoWeeds; 1/0): The bookdown #rstats package by @xieyihui made creating the updated website super easy - but also automatically creates PDF and ePub versions of the ENTIRE Site!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1033102596775596032)

> **Brian Caffo** (@bcaffo; 1/0): @rdpeng @hadleywickham @ciprianstats @jtleek @StrictlyStat @leanpub They will host an html version that they create (eg https://t.co/sWQ2Evg85N) , but you have to write it in their markdown version (kramdown I think?). I think the sweet spot is writing in bookdown, hosting your own html and then offering the pdf, epub and mobi on leanpub  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1032999953940004864)

> **Matthew Hendrickson** (@mjhendrickson; 0/0): @CMastication @rstudio It sure is! There are even so many great R texts (https://t.co/vxdoQeVi2w for example). But it's nearly info overload. I'd say that as long as the reader can follow the thread and have all the info in one place, great. Being pointed to useful content if desired is a plus.

These issues are totally foreign to me because you'd have to go out of your way to render a report with knitr in anything but a totally clean environment.

# xaringan

> **Danielle Navarro** (@djnavarro; 2/0): @cantabile I think it was an iframe html element. I made the slides using https://t.co/mYVbAtJ08p but I imagine you could do the same trick by in xaringan, right?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1033201916254216192)

> **Charles T. Gray** (@cantabile; 0/0): Hey @djnavarro, in your awesome useR keynote, you had a slide that previewed a webpage, if I recall. Trying to figure out how to do it now.

Did you make it in xaringan? Is it just a screenshot? Is the script for the keynote available on your github?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1033200803836641281)
