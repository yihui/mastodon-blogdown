Can old posts be kept or is it necessary to redo everything? #rstats #blogdown #quarto #posit  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/tim_mendonca/status/1639276656308224002)

> **Matt Peeples** (@PattMeeples; 13/0): You can also run a browser-based instance of R, R-studio, or Python linked to all the data to replicate all of the results from the book without downloading anything. This uses the supercool Binder application (see Bookdown or GitHub project for a link). Give it a try! 4/9 https://t.co/sRkXR9TgWk  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/PattMeeples/status/1639155907287449600)

> **Matt Peeples** (@PattMeeples; 13/0): We are committed to open data and reproducibility and thus, the entire Bookdown project and all the data used in the book are available on GitHub. You can install the entire project and all of the code/data as a repository to use in your own projects 3/9 https://t.co/pbAHPeXbjG  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/PattMeeples/status/1639155905467121666)

> **Matt Peeples** (@PattMeeples; 13/0): The centerpiece is a comprehensive Bookdown project which provides code for all the analyses in the book in R, Python, and other formats. We plan on continuing to grow this resource (in fact, we added 5 new topics while the book was in press). 2/9 https://t.co/rlJTPU5ltZ  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/PattMeeples/status/1639155903701356544)

> **Daniël Lakens @lakens@mastodon.social** (@lakens; 3/0): @grimbough @deevybee It worked!!! Thanks so much! I had been using the bookdown command from the dropdown menu before - but that consistently failed. Only chapter headings are off - I might explore what I do wrong there (it is all chapter 0). https://t.co/Ys2FqapYSN  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/lakens/status/1638081155361644546)

> **Mike Smith** (@grimbough; 2/0): @lakens @deevybee Looking closer, I think you already have the relevant settings in _output.yml  You can just do:

> **Patrick Ward** (@OSPpatrick; 1/0): @datadrivenAT @TenanATC There is a GitHub repo that has it coded in Python. Also a bookdown that has it recoded with {tidymodels}. Lots of options!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/OSPpatrick/status/1639720204518453248)

Looking at your latex output it suggests something is wrong with an aux file and removing them and rebuilding might fix it. https://t.co/n1SMK7XfXy  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/alistair604/status/1637414406467231746)
